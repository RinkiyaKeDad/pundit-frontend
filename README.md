# PunDit

A fullstack project which allows users to sign up and post their awesome puns as well as view puns which other users might have posted.

Frontend is live at: https://pundit.netlify.app/

Backend has been deployed at: https://pundit-a.herokuapp.com/

## Tech

Built using React on the frontend. I've used functional components with hooks and for global state management context api has been used.
Styling has been done using material-ui. The app is fully responsive so you can view it on any screen size. JWT authentication has been used and the token is stored in the user's localstorage.

## Contribute

All contributions are more than welcome. The project was built using create-react-app. After forking and cloning it you can run `npm start` after running `npm install` to run it on your local machine. It is completely fine if you mess something up. Make a PR with your changes. If there are some conflicts in the PR I will let you know how to fix that in comments of the PR and after resolving those I'll merge your code.
